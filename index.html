			<h2>The goal</h2><a id="beginning"></a>
			<p><strong>Become an employable front-end developer in 4 months from scratch.</strong><br>I am 37 years old and I made the decision of a somehow radical (and late) career change, from manager to developer.<br.>As a summary, I graduated in Economics, worked 8 years with non-profit project management and fundraising, then about 4 years with startups (non-tech founder and marketing). Now I decided that I want to invest in being a developer. I believe I will be professionally happier as a developer. My current knowledge in coding: the basics of HTML and CSS, nothing on JavaScript, I tried to learn C#/.NET in the past and was even able to put a simple web app in production somehow. But I was kind of a "trial and error developer". Now I want to know what I'm doing.</p>
			
			<h3>Week 0 - Deciding how to study</h3>
			<p>Monday, October 31st 2016. It all begins. I still have some things to finish from my last job and a few side-projects that I'm handling, but I took this week to search and decide how I will become a developer. I decided to go with freecodecamp.com mainly. But I got a good impression from watchandcode.com, so I will try it too. And as I think there is more to becoming a developer than learning a language and there a few basic things that everyone seems to assume is common knowledge, I believe these two small courses on <a href="https://www.rithmschool.com/courses/terminal" target="_blank">Terminal</a> and <a href="https://www.rithmschool.com/courses/git" target="_blank">Git</a> are gold.</p>
			
			<h3>Week 1 - Beginning to study</h3>
			<p>I started. First 120 points at freecodecamp.com (FCC) are easy enough, as they are just about HTML+CSS. Also some projects, a <a href="http://codepen.io/deltasoneca/full/pNJBaZ" target="_blank">tribute page</a> and a <a href="http://codepen.io/deltasoneca/full/woKdQN" target="_blank">portfolio</a>. Easy as basic tasks, but it took me sometime to make them look how I imagined them. Learning at this stage is more about experimenting and tweaking on details than about completing the bare minimum requested and move on. Not my dream projects, but at the end I liked what I did.<br>Despite that, I think I spent too much time dealing with other things like side-projects and domestic stuff. I have to be more diligent to achieve about 40 hours of study per week at least. Let's see next week.</p>
			<p>Time on stuff that matters ~ 20h.<br>My level is still "trial and error and google" for basic HTML and boostrap CSS; with blind copy/paste for JS that I don't understand.</p>
			
			<h3>Week 2 - Struggling with the routine</h3>
			<p>I got to 255 points at FCC. I started to learn the basic concepts and syntax of Javascript and play with a few very basic algorithm challenges. It was interesting, although not very difficult to complete the challenges. I have the feeling that I'm actually starting to learn useful things. On the minus side I still haven't mastered my routine, with a lot of distractions, including some job interviews(on marketing stuff, not dev) that I don't even know if I want.</p>
			<p>Time on stuff that matters ~ 20h.<br>My level is basic HTML and CSS and scratching what JS is.</p>
