			<h2>The goal</h2>
			<p>Become an employable front-end developer in 4 months from scratch.<br>I am 37 years old and I made the decision of a somehow radical (and late) career change, from manager to developer.<br.>As a summary, I graduated in Economics, worked 8 years with non-profit project management and fundraising, then about 4 years with startups (non-tech founder and marketing). Now I decided that I want to invest in being a developer. I believe I will be professionally happier as a developer. My current knowledge in coding: the basics of HTML and CSS, nothing on JavaScript, I tried to learn C#/.NET in the past and was even able to put a simple web app in production somehow. But I was kind of a "trial and error developer". Now I want to know what I'm doing.</p>

			<h3>Week 0 - Deciding how to study</h3>
			<p>I still have some things to finish from my last job and a few side-projects that I'm handling, but I took this week to search and decide how I will become a developer. I decided to go with freecodecamp.com mainly. But I got a good impression from watchandcode.com, so I will try it too. And as I think there is more to becoming a developer than learning a language and there a few basic things that everyone seems to assume is common knowledge, I believe these two small courses on Terminal(https://www.rithmschool.com/courses/terminal) and Git (https://www.rithmschool.com/courses/git) are gold.</p>
