			<h2>The goal</h2><a id="beginning"></a>
			<p><strong>Become an employable front-end developer in 4 months from scratch.</strong><br>I am 37 years old and I made the decision of a somehow radical (and late) career change, from manager to developer.<br.>As a summary, I graduated in Economics, worked 8 years with non-profit project management and fundraising, then about 4 years with startups (non-tech founder and marketing). Now I decided that I want to invest in being a developer. I believe I will be professionally happier as a developer. My current knowledge in coding: the basics of HTML and CSS, nothing on JavaScript, I tried to learn C#/.NET in the past and was even able to put a simple web app in production somehow. But I was kind of a "trial and error developer". Now I want to know what I'm doing.</p>
			
			<h3>Week 0 - Deciding how to study</h3>
			<p>Monday, October 31st 2016. It all begins. I still have some things to finish from my last job and a few side-projects that I'm handling, but I took this week to search and decide how I will become a developer. I decided to go with freecodecamp.com mainly. But I got a good impression from watchandcode.com, so I will try it too. And as I think there is more to becoming a developer than learning a language and there a few basic things that everyone seems to assume is common knowledge, I believe these two small courses on <a href="https://www.rithmschool.com/courses/terminal" target="_blank">Terminal</a> and <a href="https://www.rithmschool.com/courses/git" target="_blank">Git</a> are gold.</p>
			
			<h3>Week 1 - Beginning to study</h3>
			<p>I started. First 120 lessons at freecodecamp.com (FCC) are easy enough, as they are just about HTML+CSS. Also some projects, a <a href="http://codepen.io/deltasoneca/full/pNJBaZ" target="_blank">tribute page</a> and a <a href="http://codepen.io/deltasoneca/full/woKdQN" target="_blank">portfolio</a>. Easy as basic tasks, but it took me sometime to make them look how I imagined them. Learning at this stage is more about experimenting and tweaking on details than about completing the bare minimum requested and move on. Not my dream projects, but at the end I liked what I did.<br>Despite that, I think I spent too much time dealing with other things like side-projects and domestic stuff. I have to be more diligent to achieve about 40 hours of study per week at least. Let's see next week.</p>
			<p>Time on stuff that matters ~ 20h.<br>My level is still "trial and error and google" for basic HTML and boostrap CSS; with blind copy/paste for JS that I don't understand.</p>
			
			<h3>Week 2 - Struggling with the routine</h3>
			<p>255 lessons completed at FCC. I started to learn the basic concepts and syntax of Javascript and play with a few very basic algorithm challenges. It was interesting, although not very difficult to complete the challenges. I have the feeling that I'm actually starting to learn useful things. On the minus side I still haven't mastered my routine, with a lot of distractions, including some job interviews(on marketing stuff, not dev) that I don't even know if I want.</p>
			<p>Time on stuff that matters ~ 20h.<br>My level is basic HTML and CSS and scratching what JS is.</p>
			
			<h3>Week 3 - Starting to build stuff</h3>
			<p>264 lessons completed at FCC. Not a great deal in points at FCC, but that doesn't represent actual hours of dedication. I am developing the Intermediate Front End Development Projects, 4 projects with expected 100 hours of study, but I did the first in ~20 hours. I am having fun and achieving my goals. One project became this <a href="http://www.perfil.med.br/hnqm.html" target="_blank">Show HN</a>, nothing big, but I'm proud of it.<br>I could have studied more, but I was productive developing a side-project for some possible complementary income in the future: www.perfil.med.br - static website creator for doctors. This is just the business side to start selling, but I plan to continuously develop the back-end. For now I'm planning to use Siteleaf for it.</p>
			<p>Time on stuff that matters ~ 20h.<br>My level is starting to understand what Javascript is.</p>
			
			
			<h3>Week 4 - Getting the basics of JS right</h3>
			<p>266 lessons completed at FCC. Just finished the two last intermediate projects, which took me one day each. With that I finished my stated goal for the first month! Yey! :) I used that completed section as a pause to investigate other resources. I completed the initial, free course at <a href="" target="_blank">watchandcode.com</a>. Very well done, despite using video, which I do not like for learning resources. I passed through some repeated content, but I learned more than a few useful things. The next courses are paid, but I am considering subscribing after I finish FCC. It covers some important topics that are not common in other online courses, like how to read unfamiliar code, test-driven development. Regarding my side-project perfil.med.br, I did not do any more development. But I spent some good time at it trying to sell it. Some ads, one sale :). Now I will just try to talk to potential customers, but won't spend that much time in it anymore. The idea of it is to be a slow and steady dedication.</p>
			<p>Time on stuff that matters ~ 30h.<br>My level is still starting to understand what Javascript is.</p>
			
			<h3>Week 5 - A little bit of backend JS</h3>
			<p>Still 266 lessons completed at FCC. I found out a great learning resource: a <a href="http://trysparkschool.com/" target="_blank">course to create a "Twitter Clone"</a> from scratch. Not actually a fully functional twiter clone, of course, but a great resource. It starts from the very basics of installing the right tools, how to use terminal and go on step by step on a very hands-on and taking-by-the-hand approach. While going through the course I adapted it to my own idea of a website where people write reviews of everything without using stars ratings or similar stuff. The course uses Nodejs+Expressjs and MySQL to create a functional CRUD web app. It is online at <a href="http://www.opusnota.com/" target="_blank">www.opusnota.com</a>. The deploy is not actually covered at the course and I suffered a lot to try doing it at Azure, failed to properly connect to the database and quit. Then I suffered a little less trying to deploy it using Heroku, but at least I succeeded. I spent some time styling the website and including the "Hacker News Best Comments" project that I made for FCC, so now opusnota.com is my de facto portfolio.</p>
			<p>Time on stuff that matters ~ 40h.<br>My level is still starting to understand what Javascript is on front-end and a small scracth on what it is capable at the back-end through NodeJS.</p>
					
			<h3>Week 6 - Algorithm sprint</h3>
			<p>Back to FCC, 287 lessons completed. All of them algorithm practice. It was fun. I only got stuck at "find the smallest common multiplier" lesson, more than a day. I went through the route of factoring the numbers in its primes to get the result. Struggled a lot, but succeeded. After completing the lesson I checked online and other solutions were a more simple tactic of looping through integers until finding the first one that matches the condition of being a "scm". Well, it was worth it do the way I did. I struggled a bit with the last lesson using Closure functions in Javascript. I completed the test kind of quickly, but I can't say I understand Closure yet. I read three or four long answers on what is it, but still. This is the kind of thing I could use a coach/mentor/teacher answering me that. I had some time to create a new project: <a href="http://www.gittutorial.online/" target="_blank">www.gittutorial.online</a>, a page that shows the most popular tutorials available at Github. The original idea was to call Github Search API to have dynamic content. But the rate limit would cut it the first two visitors. I tried to find a solution that didn't involve the creation of a backend stack by myself, but couldn't find one. So I just copied the API results to local JSON files myself that the page access directly. Someday I go back to fix it. Talking about projects, after I submitted to Hacker News, a few nice visitors tried to hack my database with SQL and JS injections on the comments. The "twitter clone course" that the website was based on predicted this kind of attack and I bragged about it myself on HN. But a few days later I realized someone succeeded, all my data was gone and all comments submitted were replaced by a "John Skeet was here". I actually knew that someone with the skills could do it and I have no knowledge at all to even start figuring out what was the breach, so I just deleted all the DB rows and let it go. No surprise here that I can't write production-ready secure backend code.</p>
			<p>Time on stuff that matters ~ 40h.<br>My level is: basic Javascript, a small scracth of back-end environment and NodeJS code.</p>
